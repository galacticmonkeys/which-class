            <div class="panel-body">CS10 is geared for non-majors and majors who have not programmed before. It teaches many big ideas (e.g., social implications of computing, how the internet works, data, creativity), uses a really friendly graphical language, as well as set students up for success in CS61A by providing them an introduction to Python.

          <div class="panel-body">CS 61A teaches programming, not how to use one particular programming language. It considers a series of techniques for controlling program complexity, such as functional programming, data abstraction, and object-oriented programming.  By the end of the class, students should find that picking up a new programming language is but a few days’ work

          <div class="panel-body">CS61AS is an alternate intro CS course that covers the same concepts as 61A, but in a different class format and programming language. It’s a lab based class (no lecture, spend most of your time one-on-one with the TAs in lab), and there are no midterms (there are instead smaller, retake-able quizzes).

      <h2>On Taking CS10</h2>
      <h4>Michael Ball</h4>
      <em>CS10 Summer 2015 Lecturer, CS10 Head TA</em><br><br>
      <blockquote>
CS10 is, in many ways, unique. A large goal of CS10 is to expose students to many topics of computer science, including graphics, Game Theory, Human-Computer Interaction, distributed computing and some others depending on the semester. There is a sizable discussion about the social aspects of computing and how that affects everyone, which is enjoyable for many students because it’s a different thought process than programming, but is also something that some students may prefer to skip.<br><br>

CS10 focuses on helping you figure out how to structure programs and solve problems, like any other CS class. The use of Snap! is a really good starting point if you’re unsure about CS or programming but does require some transition to a language like Python, which is done during the final third of CS10. CS10 covers about 85% of topics that CS61A does, but at a bit less depth than 61A. For example, in both classes you learn about recursion and memoization (among many topics) but in CS 61A, you will spend more time analyzing complex recursive functions or implementing memoization whereas CS10 will cover these topics but you won’t be assessed at as deep a level.<br><br> 

People who are motivated by personal creativity will almost certainly find CS10’s personal projects more fulfilling, IMO. CS10 projects certainly give you more free reign, and emphasize the creative aspect of computer science, rather than the technical aspect.<br><br>

      <h2>On Taking 61A</h2>
      <h4>Andrew Huang</h4>
      <em>61A Summer 2014 Co-Lecturer, Fall 2014/Spring 2015 EECS Course Manager, 61AS/61A/61B TA</em><br><br>
      <blockquote>
        From my experience, there are a nontrivial number of students with no prior programming experience who have a really tough time with 61A. When I say tough, I mean something like “this class takes more time than all the other classes I’m taking combined.”<br><br>
        Programming experience doesn’t really speak to whether or not you’re prepared, it’s more nuanced than that. Once you have programmed for an extended period of time, you develop this resistance to failure (pressing on despite hardship) which is essential to doing well in 61A. That’s what’s really key in being able to handle this class.<br><br>
        “This class is the hardest thing I’ve ever done.” is also a common (but not universal) quip among students with no programming experience. And this is a result not of any single assignment, but the fact that the course is fast paced—there’s a lot to understand and apply, and inherently not enough time to master it all (though taking fewer classes helps).<br><br>
        From this, I would say that whether or not you take this course next semester depends on how you think you would be able to handle a class that may necessarily push your limits and force you confront failure and frustration each week.

          <li> Go through the flowchart/questionnaire, I've put a lot of thought into it.</li><br>
          <li>If this will be your first semester at Berkeley, try not to do too much.  Even if you were valedictorian of your high school with a perfect GPA - there are plenty of students like that in Berkeley.  Take an easy first semester to get calibrated to Berkeley, and then you'll have a much better idea of the workload you can manage.</li>
